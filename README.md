# Sobaka
## A 3D sandbox game
You will play as a cute pup named Sobaka, but do not be deceived by<br />
this dog’s adorable looks, this dog is on a mission. During a time<br />
of distrust between 2 world woofer powers, you are out to hunt<br />
American Capitalist Pigs in the cities of Mother Russia, but where<br />
does your loyalty truly lie? 

Sobaka’s Great Escape is a 3D sandbox game where you must sabotage<br />
enemy spy actions by sniffing, sneaking, barking, and maybe even<br />
biting.
